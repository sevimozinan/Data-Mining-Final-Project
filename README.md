# Final Project - Data Mining 

# Red Wine Quality

In this analysis of the work, it will be determined which physiochemical properties make red wine 'good!' by using some machine learning techniques. Content of the paper is starting with introduction of the data set, and some data visualization. Then some classification and one regression technique will be applied to the data and with cross validation accuracy will be evaluated. Lastly, the best estimator will be decided according to cross validation score and conculusion.

# Data Introduction

In this dataset there are specifically red wine variants of Poteguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). For more information, read [Cortez et al., 2009].

In the data set, there 1599 different wine as row data and 12 features as columns. Furthermore, there is no nun value to deal with it and all values are numeric means that input values are float and only output value is integer.
